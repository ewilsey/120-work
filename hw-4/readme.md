["Self Portrait"](https://ewilsey.github.io/120-work/hw-4/)

#Summary of Work Done

After figuring out where I went wrong in linking last week's assignment, everything for this week's assignment really started to click into place. I started with the body of my self portrait, then moved to arms, the stripes of the shirt and then hands. Next I made the lower neck shape, the throat and then the head shape. From there I made the eyes and the pupils. After the eyes, I made the nose and the ears. The mouth and eyebrows were second to last on the head because I wasn't sure at first how to manage the shape's correctly. The last head piece would then be the hair, four pieces in all. After adjusting the colors of the finished self portrait, I added a design to the stripes, which turned into a boat, so I changed the colors once again and called it good.

#Steps Taken

I spent a few hours studying the way shapes worked and how to color them. To get started on my character I watched a few minutes of the example video. As soon as I picked my character shape, I was own. I did go back to previous sections of the week for references on shapes and how to tinker with them. I started from the bottom and moved up. If I could mirror a piece I did, for example: the arms, the stripes, hands, ears, eyes, pupils and eye brows. I used Jerry Smith from "Rick and Morty" as a guideline for my character because we have a similar build, except that I wear glasses, don't frown and I'm not a Jerry, I'm a Rick(belch).

#Issues

In this assignment I had very little issues. I did need to reference how to plug in certain parameters for the line because it was annoying but other than that this assignment went pretty well. I was able to use rotate and translate to help with lining things up exactly how I wanted them. The color picker was awesome, I'm glad that I didn't have to guess at the colors. I did want to do more, but when the shirt logo turned out as cool as it did, I decided to stop.

#Addional Info

I did not seek the help of my peers because I was able to figure everything out quickly. I had zero issues this week. I also did not give any advice to any of my peers, it looked like everyone had everything handled and I didn't want to be the fifth redundant comment. I will make a better effort at reaching out in the coming weeks.
