#hw-3 Response

This assignment is a week late because I could not figure out why the above link was not working until I added the correct directory /empty-example/ that I thought I was in: /hw-3/. I figured out where I went wrong today. I copied and named the wrong file, but now that I have gotten it to work and figured out where I went wrong, I will be keeping it this way for now because I have this week's homework assignment to do. I have had a hard experience recently managing my time to allow proper dedication to this class. I am going to fix that very soon.

Where I went wrong: Everything in the assignment and p5 was working well for me up until the time I tried to get the original link to work on GitHub. I kept getting an error-404 message for ewilsey.github.io/120-work/hw-3/. I deleted the hw-3 file, and started again from the video lecture and made it to the end where we verify the link on the GitHub repository, and again error-404. I thought back to when we were testing the index.html files by opening them through the web browser, I noticed the link was different from the web browser than it was on GitHub. I copied the ending of the link, empty-example/index.html and pasted it after the non working /120-work/hw-3/ link on GitHub and - it worked. Eureka! Knowing that /index.html is redundant, I shortened it to empty-example/ and it still worked. I tested my theory once again by deleted my additional ending so it would once again reflect the  ... /120-work/hw-3/ link, as shown in the video lecture, giving me another error-404. When I went back to Atom, I was able to confirm my suspicions about the wrong file being copied and low and behold the index I wanted was 2 levels down in the correct empty-example file that I should have copied and renamed all along, and somehow messed it up not once, but twice.

I did not post my issues to issue tracker and I did not help my fellow classmates with their problems this week. I was not in a good place to be giving or receiving advice. I will do better.
