["Pointer Truck"](https://ewilsey.github.io/120-work/hw-5/)

#Summary of Work Done

Made a truck, tried to get tires to spin, could not figure it out in time, will rework this weekend.

#Steps Taken

I started with the wheels, and I should have made them spin before continuing on because now that the truck is all done, I can not figure it out.

#Issues

Can't get wheels to spin, tried following examples but it either breaks the code or pins the truck to the corner.
#Addional Info

I did not seek the help of my peers because I was able to figure everything out quickly. Not many issues other than wheel spin, doubt anyone else is having the same problem.
