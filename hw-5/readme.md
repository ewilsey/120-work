#Summary of Work Done

Made a truck, tried to get tires to spin, could not figure it out in time, will rework this weekend. | Have since reworked and was able to figure out how to get the colors to change, so I added color chaning effects to the sun, sky and grass.

#Steps Taken

I started with the wheels, and I should have made them spin before continuing on because now that the truck is all done, I can not figure it out. | Still haven't quite got the wheels spinning yet, but I did figure out how to make color change work. I was trying to get color to chaning in the color picker and that doesn't work, you have to use the basic "( 0, 0, 0, )" format.

#Issues

Can't get wheels to spin, tried following examples but it either breaks the code or pins the truck to the corner.
| Still can't get wheels to spin but I did get color to work, previously changing anything in the code after I had made the truck caused the truck to lock to the corner, or I would lose all color. Fixed by making the color code simpler and once it worked I applied it to three different sources.
#Addional Info

I did not seek the help of my peers because I was able to figure everything out quickly. Not many issues other than wheel spin, doubt anyone else is having the same problem. | Was able to put some time in today getting everything to work the way the assignment had asked it to, I still would like to get the wheels to spin but at least the color is animated. I went in to this class thinking that I was going to hate it, because I am not math oriented and the examples I saw for coding weren't fun at all, but the last couple of assignments have been a blast and reignited the computer side of animating for me, something I haven't done outside of a console or painting programs. Even though I haven't been getting everything done in a timely matter, I am still picking up a great deal of information, and if I can manage my time better, hopefully I will do well in the class.
