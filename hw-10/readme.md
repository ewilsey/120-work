# HW 10
<!--
Created an array of numbers.
Started with 4 variables, extended to 12 to fill screen width.
Created a for loop with array.
Tested for loop with array.
Tinkered with arrays, added translate to for loop to create interesting swirl.
Created second array with negative values and adjusted to link array 4 ellipses.
Defined a new function: swirlA.
Defined a second function: swirlB.
Called SwirlA, SwirlB in draw funtion.
Played on the p5js reference page with lines, learned how to grid out a square.
Made it interesting.

##ISSUES
<!--

Major:
While following along with the Shiffman examples on Arrays, I was unable to
replicate the 7.2 example. I could make the background and canvas, but the
ellipses would not appear.
Fix: I removed fill, added stroke and reworked the code in a backwards fashion
to determine what other mistakes I made. I rediscovered that if you put a
semicolon in a for loop function between the () and {}, the code will break.

Minor:
Using 12 parameters in each array was too many, ellipses would fall off canvas.
Fix: Limited to 10.

Negative values on swirlB did not match positive values of swirlA.
Fix: added -10 to swirlB values to link 5th ellipses of each function.
