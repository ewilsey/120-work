This is my first edited document for one of Dr. Musick's Creative Coding Media Arts course for the Fall 2017 semester at U of M.
I think I am starting to get a hang of things. Studying and practice is key.

I have added this file and other files in my text editor!!!!


Other stuff:

I have now made changes alongside the GitHub Desktop Demo.
