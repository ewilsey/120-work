# HW 8
<!--
What I did:
  I made a canvas that changes background colors while staying dark to allow
  foreground objects to stand out. Foreground objects have fill removed, random
  stroke with bright colors. The foreground objects will change shape size based
  on mouse position.

This was not my first idea:
  I originally planned on having shaped that changed with the mouse in front of
  rain drops coming down the canvas but I couldn't figure the logistics. I was
  able to get 3 shapes to converge in the center but then the objects I wanted
  to come down were stuck to the top of the canvas and when I tried to model my
  code after examples, the code would break or the objects would not move. I
  was able to play around with the code enough to find something I liked and
  then removed the three converging objects as they overcomplicated the piece.

I like:
  I like that the finished project looks like 90's grunge artwork. It reminds me
  of the opening credits of Bio-Dome.

What I would change:
  What I would like to see happen is having the shapes change drastically into
  recognizable objects like in Bio-Dome. The shapes do change, just not as much
  as I would like.

Side Notes:
  I did not reach out for help this week. I did have issues with GitHub being
  launched from Atom and the terminal. I was able to get it to launch
  from the Command Console.
