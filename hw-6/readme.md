["Algorithmic Sketch"](https://ewilsey.github.io/120-work/hw-6/)

#Summary of Work Done

Started by experimenting with the examples given on the course website. Played with parameters and tried adding some of my own and removing others. Tested and retested all changes from sketch on Index.html. Found an Algorithmic pattern that I like.

#Steps Taken

Put background in Setup. Set global variables. Implemented test variables and constraints with random colors. Created a tube of rungs, then two tubes, then randomized the colors. Went back to one tube. Then I was able to split the tube up into randomly placed rings of smaller sizes, seemed to be a better algorithm. Created rectangle shapes, isolated them to 1/4 of the canvas and isolated the ellipses to a separate 1/4.

#Issues

The windowWidth and windowHeight seem to be larger than the actual window itself. Also the right side border seems to be dimmer than the left side. Attempted to add a thin frame to the border but really didn't confine the next lines like it did in the example, instead it created a filter effect. Had issues getting a second random shape to come up, rect(); or triangle();. Figured out that rect(); needs 4 parameters as opposed to ellipse(); needing only 3. Somewhat stumped on next step... might leave painting as is or add some more moving pieces. I do need to figure out the map function better.

#Addional Info

Attempted to create as many issues as possible so that I can try and force myself out of my comfort zone and reach out for outside help when I get stuck this time.
