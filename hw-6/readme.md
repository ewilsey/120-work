#Summary of Work Done

Started by experimenting with the examples given on the course website.

#Steps Taken

Put background in Setup. Set global variables. Implemented test variables and constraints with random colors.

#Issues

The windowWidth and windowHeight seem to be larger than the actual window istelf. Also the right side border seems to be dimmer than the left side. Attempted to add a thin frame to the border but really didn't confine the next lines like it did in the example, instead it created a filter effect.

#Addional Info

Attempted to create as many issues as possible so that I can try and force myself to reach out for outside help when I get stuck this time.
