# HW 7 | Describe then Alter the Bouncing Ball

## Description of What the Original Code is Doing

<!--

Description of original code.


The original code is painting an algorithmic sketch with a bouncing ball being
acting as a paint brush, while remaining in the confines of the canvas.  

Why is it working the way it is?

The closer you click to 0,0 the slower the ball moves -
creating a thicker more solid line, the further away you click from 0,0 the
faster the ball moves - creating a stamping illusion. You can exploit this
feature to alter the painting without changing the direction of the ball.

What does each line do?


How can you make the ball change direction?

By clicking on the ball.
