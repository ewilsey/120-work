# HW 7 | Describe then Alter the Bouncing Ball

## Description of What the Original Code is Doing

<!--

Description of original code.

The original code is painting an algorithmic sketch with a bouncing ball
acting as a continuous paint brush stroke, while remaining in the confines of
the canvas.  

Why is it working the way it is?

The closer you click to 0,0 the slower the ball moves -
creating a thicker more solid line, the further away you click from 0,0 the
faster the ball moves - creating a trailing effect.

What does each line do?

Lines 3 thru 10 creates the 'ball' variable and establishes its parameters.
Lines 12 thru 15 establish the setup function and creates a canvas w/ white bg.
Line 19 draw function starts.
Lines 21 and 22 creates 'Boolean Statements'.
Lines 25 thru 30 are the 'If Statements'.
Line 32 fill object white.
line 33 create object ellipse.
line 34 end draw function.
line 36 establish mouse press function.
line 37 and 38 maps mouse press functions for x and y.
line 39 ends mouse press function.

How can you make the ball change direction?

You can change direction by clicking directly on the canvas. Clicking towards
the top left slows the ball down, clicking towards the bottom speeds the ball
up. This also translates to how drastically the balls direction will change, top
left clicks are slowest and cause slighter changes, bottom of canvas clicks are
the most drastic on direction. Note: clicking on the same point twice will not
change the speed or direction of the ball, the clicks must be in separate
coordinates.

## How did you alter the sketch?

<!--

Made the canvas full screen.
Changed the background color to 'black'.
Shorted the gaps between functions from 3 to 2 lines.
Eliminated Stroke.
Changed colors and transparency of ellipse to change depending on the x and y
coordinates of the ball.
