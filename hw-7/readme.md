# HW 7 | Describe then Alter the Bouncing Ball

## Description of What the Original Code is Doing

<!--

Description of original code.

The original code is painting an algorithmic sketch with a bouncing ball
acting as a continuous paint brush stroke, while remaining in the confines of
the canvas.  

Why is it working the way it is?

The closer you click to 0,0 the slower the ball moves -
creating a thicker more solid line, the further away you click from 0,0 the
faster the ball moves - creating a trailing effect. You can exploit this
feature to alter the painting while having minimum impact on the  direction of
the ball.

What does each line do?

Lines 3 thru 10 creates the 'ball' variable and establishes its parameters.
Lines 12 thru 15 establish the setup function and creates a canvas w/ white bg.
Line 19 draw function starts.
Lines 21 and 22 creates 'Boolean Statements'.
Lines 25 thru 30 are the 'If Statements'.
Line 32 fill object white.
line 33 create object ellipse.
line 34 end draw function.
line 36 establish mouse press function.
line 37 and 38 maps mouse press functions for x and y.
line 39 ends mouse press function.

How can you make the ball change direction?

You can change direction by clicking directly on the ball, or by clicking on the
canvas. Clicking on the ball has a more drastic impact on the ball's direction
and will also impact the speed of said ball; likewise, clicking on the canvas
has a more drastic impact on the speed of the ball but will also slightly
impact the ball's direction.

## How did you alter the sketch?

<!--

Line 13 was changed to make the canvas full screen.
Line 14 changed the background color to light blue using color picker.
Line 17 was deleted to shorted the gap between setup and draw to 2 lines.
