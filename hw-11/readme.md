##HW-11
<!--

Followed Shiffman example for moving bubbles with class and objects. Added
second set of bubbles, then started piecing together a flower, and then after 5
bubbles it sort of looked like a butterfly so I chose that for my theme for the
remainder of my image. I changed the background to green and then ajusted the
ellipses (previously bubbles) to wings, and then rotated them.
-->


#Issues
<!--
Wanted to turn bubbles into eyes to make more interesting, having trouble
figuring out how to have complicated shapes and how to convert old structured
codes into object oriented codes..
-->

#Resolve
<!--
Decided not to go with a shape on top of a shape (figured out how to though)
and instead added multiple shapes to create one single image.
