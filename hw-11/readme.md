##HW-11
<!--

Followed Shiffman example for moving bubbles with class and objects. Added
second set of bubbles, then started piecing together a flower, and then after 5
bubbles it sort of looked like a butterfly so I chose that for my theme for the
remainder of my image. I changed the background to green and then ajusted the
ellipses (previously bubbles) to wings, and then rotated them. The ending effect
practically be the same, when the mouse clicks and drags, the image will be re-
generated with similar effect. What I changed is the shape of the image, the
colors and generally tried to make it more interesting.

#Issues
<!--
Wanted to turn bubbles into eyes to make more interesting, having trouble
figuring out how to have complicated shapes and how to convert old structured
codes into object oriented codes.. Had to learn how to find the quandrants on an
arc.
-->

#Resolve
<!--
Decided not to go with a shape on top of a shape (figured out how to though)
and instead added multiple shapes to create one single image.

#PI CHART
<!--
Top Left 1/4 -> -PI,-HALF_PI
Bottom Left 1/4 -> HALF_PI,PI
Bottom Right 1/4 -> 0,HALF_PI
Top Right 1/4 -> -HALF_PI, 0
